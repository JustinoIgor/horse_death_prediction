# Horse Death Prediction

This project was proposed as the solution to a fictitious business problem


## Dataset

The dataset used for the development of the project was generated synthetically
from real public data

## Method

This project was developed based on the CRISP-DS methodology for solving Data 
Science problems and is structured in the following steps:

## Business Problem

The Horse Health Hospital intends to determine the probability of death of the
horses that need to be operated for the analysis of the results of the
preliminary exams.

The Horse Health company has the following costs:

1.For each horse that undergoes a surgical operation, an amount of $1500 is received.
2.When the horse survives, the expenses reach $1300, but a value of $200 is received 
from the customer who owns the animal.
3. If the horse dies, the expense reaches $1200.

So each horse that survives makes a profit of $400 and each horse that dies 
makes a profit of $300

Horse Health believes it will be able to significantly reduce its costs if
it can predict whether an animal will survive or not.

The Hospital believes it will achieve the following results:
 
1. For each dead horse predicted to be dead, the company will save $200
2. For each live horse predicted to be live will result in an extra $100
3. Dead horses predicted to be alive will incur additional expenses of $200
4. Live horses predicted to be dead result in a loss of $200

Then, a high accuracy model was requested to be delivered to determine
the probability of each horse dying after the operation.
The model must be quickly accessed by company employees and must return
a value that corresponds to the probability of death.

In addition, a report was requested that shows the model's performance
and results. This report must contain the following information:

1. What is the model's accuracy.
2. After analyzing the data, what were the main insights
3. What would the company's revenue be for the next 400 horses
 without the implementation of the proposed model.
4. What is the expected revenue for the service of the next
 400 horses after the implementation of the model.
